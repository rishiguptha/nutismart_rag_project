Muscle-strengthening activities should be gradually increased over time, starting with 1 day a week at a light or moderate level [1].

      "generated_answer": "During exercise, water plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature [5]. Sweating is the primary mechanism for cooling the body [1, 2]. As sweat evaporates from the skin, it removes thermal energy, cooling the body [2]. Adequate water intake is essential to produce sweat and balance the loss of fluids [2]. The body increases circulation of blood to the surface to dissipate heat and initiates sweating to cool the surface [3]. Warm blood flows to blood vessels under the skin, transferring heat to the environment, while sweat glands release warm water; as the water evaporates, it carries away heat, and cooler blood circulates back to the body core [10]. The rate of evaporation depends on humidity [1].\n\n**Sources:**\n[1] Anatomy_and_Physiology.pdf, Page 1108\n[2] Anatomy_and_Physiology.pdf, Page 32\n[3] Anatomy_and_Physiology.pdf, Page 1106\n[5] Human Nutrition: 2020.pdf, Page 264\n[10] Anatomy_and_Physiology.pdf, Page 70\n",

      "generated_answer": "Physical activity plays a critical role in weight management due to its impact on energy balance [3]. When trying to control body weight, both physical activity and caloric intake must be considered [3]. Physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess weight, and sustaining successful weight loss [3, 9]. Increasing energy expenditure through physical activity allows for the consumption of more food while maintaining a healthy weight [1]. Breaking up sitting time with brief periods of increased energy expenditure activities, such as walking for five minutes every hour, can help maintain weight and even aid in weight loss [6]. A metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is a unit used to describe the energy expenditure of a specific activity [2].\n\n**Sources:**\n[1] Human Nutrition: 2020.pdf, Page 982\n[2] Physical Activity Guidelines 2nd Edition.pdf, Page 36\n[3] Physical Activity Guidelines 2nd Edition.pdf, Page 37\n[6] Human Nutrition: 2020.pdf, Page 535\n[9] Physical Activity Guidelines 2nd Edition.pdf, Page 62\n",

      "ideal_answer": "Physical activity increases energy expenditure above resting rate. Moderate-to-vigorous activity significantly raises expenditure, aiding weight management by creating an energy deficit when combined with appropriate energy intake. Activity also helps build lean mass, further increasing energy needs. (Verify exact wording and source/page in your docs)",
