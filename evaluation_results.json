      "Levels of Physical Activity Throughout the Guidelines, reference is made to four levels of aerobic physical activity: inactive, insufficiently active, active, and highly active. This classification for adults is useful because these categories are related to how much health benefit a person obtains at a given level and how to become more active. The focus on aerobic physical activity for the levels should not be interpreted to suggest that other types of",

In addition, the following key guidelines are just for older adults: \u2022 As part of their weekly physical activity, older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle -strengthening activities. \u2022 Older adults should determine their level of effort for physical activity relative to their level of fitness.",

The fontanelles are the soft spots on an infant\u2019s head. They are important during birth because these areas allow the skull to change shape as it squeezes through the birth canal. After birth, the fontanelles allow for continued growth and expansion of the skull as the brain enlarges. The largest fontanelle is 260 7 \u2022 Axial Skeleton",

It is surrounded by muscles on both its anterior (deep) and posterior (superficial) sides, and thus does not articulate with the ribs of the thoracic cage.
