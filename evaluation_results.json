Highly active adults, doing more than the equivalent of 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and at least 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity each week, should maintain or continue to increase [1]. Muscle-strengthening activities can be gradually increased over time, starting with 1 day a week at a light or moderate level [1]. Over time, the number of days a week can be increased to 2, and then possibly to more than 2 [1].

Older adults who do not yet do the equivalent of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week can gain health benefits by doing small amounts of physical activity [1]. As part of their weekly physical activity, older adults should do multicomponent physical activity that includes balance training as well as aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities [6]. Older adults should strongly consider walking as one good way to get aerobic activity because it has many health benefits and a low risk of injury [7].

To meet the aerobic component, adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, or an equivalent combination [2, 3]. Aerobic activity should ideally be spread throughout the week [3]. Examples of moderate-intensity aerobic activity include brisk walking [6]. Episodes of physical activity can be divided throughout the day or week based on personal preference [1]. Aerobic physical activity has three components: intensity, frequency, and duration [5]. In addition to activities that meet the key guidelines, activities such as stretching, warming up, and cooling down may also be included [7].\n**Sources:**\n[2] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 15\n[3] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 8\n[4] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 57\n[5] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 29\n[6] adults.html, Page Web\n[7] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 24\n[1] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 57\n",

    "generated_answer": "Physical activity plays a critical role in weight management due to its effect on energy balance [3]. Increased energy expenditure through physical activity allows for a greater food intake while maintaining a healthy weight [1]. Physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy body weight, losing weight, or maintaining weight loss [3, 9]. Even breaking up sitting time with brief periods of increased energy expenditure activities can help maintain weight and aid in weight loss [6]. Balancing caloric intake and energy expenditure is key to maintaining body weight [3, 8]. The more energy you expend, the more food you can consume without gaining weight [1]. A metabolic equivalent of task (MET) describes the energy expenditure of a specific activity [2, 4].\n\n**Sources:**\n[1] human-nutrition-text.pdf, Page 982\n[2] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 107\n[3] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 36\n[4] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 19\n[6] human-nutrition-text.pdf, Page 535\n[8] human-nutrition-text.pdf, Page 518\n[9] Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf, Page 62\n",

    "ideal_answer": "Physical activity increases energy expenditure above resting rate. Moderate-to-vigorous activity significantly raises expenditure, aiding weight management by creating an energy deficit when combined with appropriate energy intake. Activity also helps build lean mass, further increasing energy needs. (Verify exact wording and source/page in your docs)"
