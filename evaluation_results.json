      "Physical Activity / Exercise Recommendations When we talk about ho w much e xercise someone should get, we need to consider the goal of the individual. F or example, if someone wants to be a high level athlete, they are going to need to c ommit more time to e xercise than some one who is not. The time commitment could also look different if weight loss is a goal vs. exercise for health. For now, we will just talk about general recommendations for a healthy lifestyle. According to the ACSM (2013), adults betw een the ages of 18-65 who are healthy, should at least p articipate in 150 min (e xample: 30 min/ 5 times a w eek) of moderate intensity aerobic (think exercise that raises y our heart rate and breathing rate) a w eek or participate in 60 min (20 min/ 3 times a w eek) of vigorous exercise.

Among children and adoles- cents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate- to- vigorous intensity physical activity across the week (most of which should be aerobic), leads to health benefits. Furthermore, the guide- lines continue to reinforce the value of muscle- strengthening activity for all adults and children. The key physical activity- specific recommendations above remain largely unchanged from 2010 and are consistent with other recently developed physical activity guidelines from several countries.13 17\u201322 What is new? There are a few important differences in the new guidelines that should be highlighted for each age group. First, in adults, the previous stipulation that physical activity should be accumu - lated in at least 10 min bouts has been removed. This change reflects the accumulated evidence from cohort studies, which shows physical activity of any bout duration is associated with",

All adults should undertake 150\u2013300 min of moderate- intensity, or 75\u2013150 min of vigorous- intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate- intensity and vigorous- intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60 min/day of moderate- to- vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle- strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold.

      "In addition, and even if you chose not to complete the above assessments, reflect on the importance of body fat and the potential risks of too little or too much. What are lifestyle choices that can promote a healthy body composition? Chapter Overview In this chapter, you learned about body composition. Body composition is the ratio of fat mass to fat-free mass (ACSM, 2013). Typically, when we are assessing body composition, we look to measure body fat, which is then expressed as a percent of the overall body that is made up of adipose (fat) tissue. The difference between looking at body composition or body fat percentage vs. body weight was discussed in detail. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (n.d), body weight can be defined as \u201cThe mass or quantity of heaviness of an individual.\u201d It is expressed by units of pounds or BODY COMPOSITION | 179",

Each method of measuring body f at has diff erent benefits. Some measurements are more pre cise but others are more convenient. W ays to assess body c omposition include Densitometry, Duel- energy X-ray absorptiometry, skinfold fat thickness measurements, and bioele ctrical impe dance procedures (Kenn y et al., 2015).

      "(ACSM 2013). It is going to be less reliable as a tool for individuals with higher muscle mass. Looking at waist circumference can be helpful to determine if someone stores a high amount of fat in the torso/ trunk region (android obesity) as storing adipose tissue in this region is associated with more disease risk (ACSM, 2013). Many methods to assess body fatness exist. Each method of measuring body fat has different benefits. Some measurements are more precise, but others are more convenient. Ways to assess body composition include Densitometry, dual-energy X- ray absorptiometry, skinfold fat thickness measurements, and bioelectrical impedance procedures (Kenny et al. 2015). Obesity is a problem in the US, as well as in other developed and developing countries ( World Health Organization, n.d.),.

For example, dollars, pounds, and time are all easily measurable. They can measure the money they save by counting the dollars they have. A stands for attainable. People need to be capable of doing what is needed to succeed. For example, do they have access to the resources they will need to achieve this? R stands for realistic. People need to make sure their expectations are not too big to start.
